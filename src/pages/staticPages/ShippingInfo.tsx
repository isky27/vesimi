                        VESIMI, www.vesimi.com, will NOT deal or provide any services or products to any of

                        Before we can dispatch your purchases, we may need to confirm your details with your
                        card issuer. We will do our best to keep delays to a minimum. Our delivery time starts
                        from the moment an order is accepted and includes a 24-hour period where your items
                        will be processed and dispatched by our warehouse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note this can take longer during our sale periods when it may take up to 48
                        hours for shipments to be dispatched. We work closely with our shipping partner to
                        minimize the potential impact of custom delays on our international customers.
